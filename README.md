**Welcome the nRc R coding group!**

To download the scripts and datasets for each session, click the green "Code" button and download the files as zip files. Please use a browser other than Internet Explorer (i.e. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.). Unzip the files from your "Downloads" section on your computer, then move the files to the folder you will be using as your working directory. If you get lost, do not worry -- I will walk through these steps on our first session!

**R Studio is broken up into 4 different sections**

Top left (Source): Where you write and edit scripts
Top right (Environment & History): Where you see objects and variables
Bottom left (Console): Where you see the results of running a script
Bottom right (Files, Plots, Packages, Help): Where you see files in the working directory, resulting plots, and packages to load
These sections are adjustable by hovering cursor on the boundaries of each section and dragging to adjust

**Start a new project**

In the top right corner, click on the cube with an "R" inside of it
Select "New Project"
Select "New Directory"
Select "New Project"
Select "Browse" and choose an appropriate folder or make a new folder
Select "Create Project"
By creating a "project" and working within a "project", it automatically sets the working directory -- so any spreadsheets that you work with can simply be moved to the folder containing the "project" file. Move the provided unzipped files from your downloads into this folder.

**Start a new R script**

In the top left corner, select the white paper with a green + sign
Select "R Script"
To open or import a script, select the yellow folder with the green arrow (top left corner) and select the script you want to open
To save a script, click the save button --> save your scripts often!
To run a script, highlight the section of the script you want to run, then click "Run" in the right of the script section
When writing your scripts, if something is incorrect or incomplete, a little white "x" will be listed beside the lines of code in the script with an error.
Script in R is case sensitive

If a label or variable in an excel sheet you import has capital letters, you need to include capital letters when referring to that label or variable.
Almost all functions in R are lower case

How to change the appearance of R studio

In the top bar, click "Tools". Select "Global Options", then "Appearance" and play around with the RStudio Theme and Editor theme.
R prefers to read CSV files, not regular excel files. So you will notice today, all the spreadsheets we will be working with are in CSV format.
