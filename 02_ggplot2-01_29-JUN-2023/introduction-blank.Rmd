## ❓ Course information

-   Course materials will be made available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yoitsjenna/nRc-WiSI).

-   All lessons will be recorded and recordings will be shared on Teams.

-   Although the content will be delivered in English, participants can ask questions in the chat or by email in both official languages.

-   A request has been submitted to the Client Services Center to make R and RStudio available on the Green zone.

    -   Those who were unable to install R and RStudio on their corporate machines worked around this issue by using [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (formerly RStudio Cloud) or their personal computers.

-   As always, consult your supervisor prior to using R and/or RStudio to develop data products as part of your work.

-   📣 indicates instructions and 💡 indicates tips.

## 💻 Introduction to R Markdown (1 min)

-   This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

-   When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## 🎨 Introduction to ggplot2 (1 min)

> ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl). You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

--- [Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics • ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

📣 Load the packages we'll be using:

```{r load-package}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

💡 You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session.

## 🔍 Exploring the sample data (3 min)

![](https://www.leparisien.fr/resizer/qrgtq2C8gkiP--dP3TChVRRPCbI=/932x582/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/leparisien/ZTKEM4AQQRF4ZBJSHFI6ACYDFA.jpg){width="500"}

-   Data originally comes from SNCF (Société nationale des chemins de fer français), France's national state-owned railway company.

-   We'll be using a modified version based on a CSV file from this [repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-26).

📣 Read the data:

```{r import-data}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

💡 readr is also part of the tidyverse; it provides a fast and user-friendly way to read rectangular text data. Rectangular data is a collection of variables (in columns) and observations (in rows).

📣 Read the data dictionary to explore the type and description of each variable:

| Variable                  | Type      | Description                           |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `year`                    | double    | Year of observation                   |
| `month`                   | double    | Month of observation                  |
| `service`                 | character | Type of train service                 |
| `departure_station`       | character | Departure station name                |
| `arrival_station`         | character | Arrival station name                  |
| `journey_time_avg`        | double    | Average journey time (min)            |
| `total_num_trips`         | double    | Total number of trains in time period |
| `avg_delay_all_departing` | double    | Average departure delay (min)         |
| `avg_delay_all_arriving`  | double    | Average arrival delay (min)           |
| `num_late_at_departure`   | double    | Number of trains departing late       |
| `num_arriving_late`       | double    | Number of trains arriving late        |

```{r inspect-data}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

-   Each row summarizes information on trips from one station to another for a given month and year.

    -   First row captures information on trips from **AIX EN PROVENCE** (Aix-en-Provence) to **PARIS LYON** (Paris-Gare-de-Lyon) for the month of **JANUARY 2015**.

    -   Last row captures information on trips from **ZURICH** to **PARIS LYON** for the month of **NOVEMBER 2018**.

## 📈 Histogram (5 min)

📣 Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of average journey time (numeric):

```{r histogram}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

-   We can see that the distribution of average journey time is right-skewed.

💡 Creating a plot is like building a layered cake: all plots begin with a call to `ggplot()`, supplying default data and aesthetic mappings via `aes()`. You then create layers using a `geom_*` function, adding components with `+`.

## 📈 Scatter plot (15 min)

📣 Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between average journey time (numeric) and average arrival delay (numeric):

```{r scatter-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

-   It looks as though the variance of delay increases as the average journey time increases. For journeys that average \<1 hour, arrival delays seem to be \<10 minutes. Meanwhile, for journeys that average 5 hours, arrival delays seem to be \<30 minutes.

📣 Change the look and feel of the points:

```{r scatter-plot-aes}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

📣 Add title and change axis labels:

```{r change-labels}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## 📈 Line plot (15 min)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Ch%C3%A2teau_et_Tour_Tanguy.jpg/1024px-Ch%C3%A2teau_et_Tour_Tanguy.jpg){width="443"}

-   Brest is a port city in Brittany, in northwestern France.

-   It's a special place for one of the organizers of this coding workshop!

📣 Create a line plot to show how the monthly number of trips from Paris to Brest fluctuates throughout the year:

```{r line-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

📣 Create a line plot to show how the monthly number of trips from Paris to multiple cities in Brittany fluctuate throughout the year:

```{r multi-line-plot}
brittany_cities <- c("RENNES", "BREST", "QUIMPER")

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

-   *Why does Rennes have the most frequent service?*

    -   Trains departing from Paris often separate in Rennes (first part going to Brest and the latter going to Quimper). *Open up Google Maps!*

    -   \# of trains to Rennes \~ \# of trains to Brest + \# of trains to Quimper

💡 Use [`scale_*_continuous()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html) to position scales for continuous data, [`scale_*_discrete()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_discrete.html) to position scales for discrete data, and [`scale_*_date()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_date.html) to position scales for date data.

## 📈 Bar plot (10 min)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Gare_Du_Nord_Interior%2C_Paris%2C_France_-_Diliff_%28cropped%29.jpg/1280px-Gare_Du_Nord_Interior%2C_Paris%2C_France_-_Diliff_%28cropped%29.jpg){width="517"}

-   Gare du Nord, officially Paris-Nord, is the busiest railway station in Europe by total passenger numbers.

📣 Create a bar plot to show the number of departures from Paris-Nord in 2015, by destination.

```{r bar-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

📣 Create a grouped bar plot to compare the number of departures from Paris-Nord in 2015 and 2016, by destination.

```{r multi-bar-plot}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
